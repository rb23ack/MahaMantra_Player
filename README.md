# MahaMantra_Player

- This project utilizes HTML for structure, CSS for styling and animations (e.g., spinning, falling flowers), and JavaScript for interactivity, such as audio playback, dynamic animations, and DOM manipulation.

- I used a single file to add structure, styling and web interactivity, (CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript)
  
- You can simply download the zip and implement further advancements as required.  

- There are a few more bits of work still needed to be added. This project has been made on the ocassion of New Year Eve 2024 and New Year 2025!
