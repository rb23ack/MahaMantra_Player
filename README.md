# MahaMantra_Player
This project utilizes HTML for structure, CSS for styling and animations (e.g., spinning, falling flowers), and JavaScript for interactivity, such as audio playback, dynamic animations, and DOM manipulation.


There are a few more bits of work still needed to be added. This project has been made on the ocassion of New Year Eve 2024 and New Year 2025!
